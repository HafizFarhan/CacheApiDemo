# API Cache Demo

This project is a demonstration of how to implement caching in a web API using ASP.NET Core. Caching can improve the performance and scalability of your API by storing frequently accessed data in memory, reducing the need to fetch it from the database or external services repeatedly.

## Features

- **Cache Service**: Implements caching logic to store and retrieve data.
- **Background Service**: Utilizes a background service to periodically refresh cache data.
- **API Endpoints**: Provides endpoints for retrieving and updating cached data.

## Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/example/api-cache-demo.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd api-cache-demo
    ```

3. **Restore Packages**:
    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```

4. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ``'
The application will start running on `https://localhost:7005`

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can interact with the API using tools like Postman or cURL. The API provides the following endpoints:

- **GET /api/employee/{accountCode}/{subAccountCode}/{attributeCode}**: Retrieves cached data based on the provided account, sub-account, and attribute codes.
- **POST /api/employee**: Adds or updates data in the cache.
- **POST /api/employee/loadInitialCache**: Loads initial data into the cache.

Ensure that you have appropriate permissions to access the API endpoints, and refer to the API documentation for detailed usage instructions.
